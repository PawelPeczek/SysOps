# C system programming
## Multi threading - THREAD SYNCRONIZATION
* Mutexes (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/866837/plural-form-of-word-mutex) and POSIX Semaphores
* producers and consumers problem with fixed-size buffer to forbid overproduction

## USAGE
Please point out, that cleaned_prod_cons_problem_solver.c source file is the same as prod_cons_problem_solver.c (in both versions respectively) but the first one is cleaned from "behaviour-describing" macros to make code reading easier.

## ISSUES
Please let me know in case of spotting some race coditions errors.
